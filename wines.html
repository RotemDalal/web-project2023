                        Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a
                        blending grape and for varietal wines. The name Merlot is thought to be a diminutive of merle,
                        the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness
                        and "fleshiness", combined with its earlier ripening, make Merlot a popular grape for blending
                        with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.

                        world and used primarily to produce red wine. In 1999, Syrah was found to be the offspring of
                        two obscure grapes from southeastern France, Dureza and Mondeuse Blanche. Syrah should not be
                        confused with Petite Sirah, a cross of Syrah with Peloursin dating from 1880.
                        The style and flavor profile of wines made from Syrah are influenced by the climate where the
                        grapes are grown. In moderate climates, they tend to produce medium to full-bodied wines with
                        medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint and black pepper.

                        Chardonnay is a green-skinned grape variety used in the production of white wine. The variety
                        originated in the
                        Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England
                        to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a 'rite of
                        passage' and an easy entry into the international wine market.
                        The Chardonnay grape itself is neutral, with many of the flavors commonly associated with the
                        wine being derived from such influences as terroir and oak.It is vinified in many different
                        styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak and
                        tropical fruit flavors.

                        France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage and blanc
                        due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. It is
                        possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine
                        regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a
                        component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely
                        cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Bulgaria,
                        the states of Oregon, Washington, and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs,
                        particularly from California, may also be called "Fumé Blanc", a marketing term coined by Robert
                        Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fumé.

                        to have an inky dark color and robust tannins, and are known as one of the six grapes allowed in
                        the blend of red Bordeaux wine. In France, plantations of Malbec are now found primarily in
                        Cahors in South West France, though the grape is grown worldwide. It is increasingly celebrated
                        as an Argentine varietal.
                        The grape became less popular in Bordeaux after 1956 when frost killed off 75% of the crop.
                        Despite Cahors being hit by the same frost, which devastated the vineyards, Malbec was replanted
                        and continued to be popular in that area.

                        Gewurztraminer. Gewürztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour,
                        which makes it a "white wine grape" as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly
                        referred to as "red wine grapes". The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and
                        usually off-dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gewürztraminer and lychees share
                        the same aroma compounds.

                        Union.

                        Pinot Gris, Pinot Grigio or Grauburgunder is
                        a white wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the
                        Pinot Noir variety, it normally has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name, but the
                        grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot could have
                        been given to it because the grapes grow in small pinecone-shaped clusters. The wines produced
                        from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of
                        pink, and it is one of the more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.
